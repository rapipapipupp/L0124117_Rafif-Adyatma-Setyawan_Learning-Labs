            <h2>Surakarta</h2>
            <p>Surakarta, commonly known as Solo, is a vibrant city located in Central Java, Indonesia. It is renowned for its rich cultural heritage and historical significance, serving as a major center for Javanese culture alongside its "twin" city, Yogyakarta. This city is not only a hub of traditional arts and education but also a bustling economic center with a population of approximately 550,000 residents, expanding to around 800,000 when including surrounding suburbs12.
            </p>
            <p class="text-part">Historical Background</p>
            <p>The city of Solo has deep historical roots, tracing back to the Mataram Sultanate, which once ruled much of Java. In 1745, the royal court was moved to Solo, which became the seat of the Kasunanan Kingdom. This royal legacy is still evident today, as Solo retains its status as a city ruled by a traditional monarch known as the Susuhunan. The current Susuhunan is Pakubuwono XIII, who has been in power since 2004125. Unlike Yogyakarta, which has become more commercialized and tourist-oriented, Solo has managed to preserve much of its authentic Javanese character and traditions.

            <p class="text-part">Cultural Significance</p>

The city is famous for its traditional performances such as wayang kulit (shadow puppetry) and wayang wong (theatrical performances based on the Ramayana and Mahabharata), accompanied by the enchanting sounds of gamelan orchestras. These cultural expressions are integral to the local identity and are celebrated through various festivals throughout the year13.
            </p>
            <p>The city hosts over 20 major cultural events annually, showcasing traditional arts and crafts. Notably, Solo is recognized for its batik production, with several workshops available for visitors to learn about this intricate fabric-dyeing technique. The annual Solo Batik Fashion Festival highlights this art form and attracts participants from across Indonesia43.
            </p>
            <p class="text-part">Economic Landscape</p>
            <p>As an economic center in Central Java, Solo thrives on small-to-medium enterprises that focus on traditional crafts and modern industries alike. The city's markets, such as Pasar Gede and Pasar Triwindu, offer a mix of local produce and antiques, making them popular destinations for both locals and tourists. Notably, Pasar Triwindu is famous for its antiques, where visitors can find everything from Javanese daggers to leather puppets4.

            <p class="text-part">Modern Developments</p>
